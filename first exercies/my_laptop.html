		<h2>The Unremarkable Journey of a Macbook</h2>
		<h3>Day 500 with my 3rd owner</h3>
		<p>You would think that after being owned by someone for five hundred days, they would at least throw you a party.</p>
		<p>But no, not my owner he proceeded to play some mind numbingly dumb video games, and watch a 3rd rate netflix movie Sharknado.  The movie worse than title sounds if thats possible.</p>
		<h3>Day 497 with my 3rd owner</h3>
		<p>Pretty uneventful this week, my owner keeps reading the stupidest stuff on the internet.  You don't believe me do you?  I understand that stupidest might be a tad strong, but seriously who wants to know the secret meaning behind the depth/height of their belly button?  Who cares if or what Holywood celebrites InstaFaceTwitblr about each other? </p>
		
		<h3>Day 4 of being in the car on day 492 with my 3rd owner</h3>
		<p>Sorry I haven't posted anything in over a week, my not so awsesome owner forgot to take me out of the car four days ago.</p>
		<p>How can someone leave such a beautiful piece of equipment in the harsh enviroment of an unattended car in the sun.  I almost died out there, I was sleeping and down to less than 7% before Mr Neaderthal finds me in the car and says "Oh look here's my laptop, I was wondering were it was."  I almost jumped of my screen at him, Did he actually stop wondering long enough to look in the last place he had it!!??  Nope.</p>
