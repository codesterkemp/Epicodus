		<p>If it had a facebook page I would like it.</p>
		<p>We have this bond that is unbelievably strong.</p>
		<p>I take it where ever I go</p>
		<p>If I don't know where I am, I can ask it.</p>
		<p>If I ignore it, overuse it, forget about it, All I have to do is plug it up and let it charge up a little and were as close as we ever were.</p>
		<p>It helps me talk to my other friends</p>
		<p>How did my life exist before a cellpet?</p>
